# About Google Analytics

**Google Analytics** is a free web analytics platform provided by Google.


It is also the most popular free web analytics tool on the Internet according to [Builwith report](http://trends.builtwith.com/analytics) (Feb 2016). It is a complete analytics platform offering solutions for **collecting, analyzing data and reporting the results**. Google Analytics offers also free **APIs** to export data to external systems.

## Terms of service

The common question raises: is this great tool is *really free*? To be precise, according to [Google Analytics Terms of Service](http://www.google.pl/analytics/terms/):

> Service is provided without charge to You for up to **10 million Hits per month per account.**

If you exceed this quota, you should think about [Google Analytics 360](https://www.google.com/analytics/360-suite/analytics/), former Gooogle Analytics Premium service. This premium and paid version offers you multiple times bigger data collection quota.

## What is a hit?

As you can read above, your Google Analytics account has a 10 000 000 hits per month limit. So what is a hit?

According to [Google Analytics help](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6086082?hl=en):

> **Hit** - An interaction that results in data being sent to Analytics. Common hit types include page tracking hits, event tracking hits, and ecommerce hits.

> Each time the tracking code is triggered by a user’s behavior (for example, user loads a page on a website or a screen in a mobile app), Analytics records that activity. Each interaction is packaged into a hit and sent to Google’s servers. Examples of hit types include:

> - page tracking hits
> - event tracking hits
> - ecommerce tracking hits
> - social interaction hits
