# Why?

I've decided to write this book to show how big value is hidden in data. If you have website you probably collecting data about web traffic. But if you use this data to make business decisions?

Nowadays we are swimming in _data lake_. Only if you know how to use this data you will stay on the surface :\). First step is to regularly check standard reports in your web analytics tool \(i.e. Google Analytics\).

But to stay competitive you need something more. Everybody talks about data collection. But only a few  tell you what to do with data after collect them. I try to describe this process and give you some ideas how to deal with data from Google Analytics using R.

In this book I will share my experience on this field. I hope that it will be usefull, interesting, sometimes funny and will save you time :\)

# Target audience

I wrote this book for marketers who worked with Google Analytics and know basic metrics included in this tool and know web interface. I hope that this material will be helpful in learning how to extend features of Google Analytics in daily work and learning how to use R.

If you are analyst who knows perfectly R I hope that you also find some inspirations in this book. Especialyy in learning how to connect Google Analytyics as additional data source in R and what kind of analysis you can perform on this data.
